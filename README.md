# **Monty Project**
This project focuses on implementing the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) and First-In, First-Out (FIFO) methods in a unique manner to apply these concepts to stack and queue data structures.

The concept behind Monty involves creating an interpreter for the Monty scripting language. It aims to manipulate the methods and operations of stacks and queues by utilizing this interpreter.
